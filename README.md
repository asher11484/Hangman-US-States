# Hangman App

A classic word-guessing game built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — by a non-developer.

## About

This Hangman game runs in the browser with no setup required. Just open the file and play.

I built this as a hands-on learning project using **Claude AI** and **VS Code**. With no coding background — no CS degree, no bootcamp — I wanted to see what's actually possible when you pair curiosity with AI tools.

The process was conversational: describe what you want, get code, test it, iterate. Prompt by prompt, a working app came to life.

## How to Play

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open `hangman.html` (or `index.html`) in any browser
3. Guess letters to figure out the hidden word before the hangman is complete

## Built With

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (single file)
- [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) — AI pair programmer
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — code editor

## Why This Exists

If you're in tech sales, partner management, alliances, or any non-engineering role and think coding isn't for you — this project is proof that the barrier to building isn't technical skill anymore. It's willingness to start.
