# Hangman — U.S. States Edition

A classic Hangman word-guessing game featuring all 50 US states — built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by a non-developer.

## About

Guess the US state name one letter at a time before the hangman is complete. The game tracks your wins, losses, and win rate across rounds. It runs in the browser with no setup required — just open the file and play.

I built this as a hands-on learning project using **Claude AI** and **VS Code**. With no coding background — no CS degree, no bootcamp — I wanted to see what's actually possible when you pair curiosity with AI tools.

## How to Play

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open `Hangman_US_States.html` in any browser
3. Click letters (or type on your keyboard) to guess the hidden state name
4. You get 6 wrong guesses before it's game over

**Keyboard shortcuts:** N = next round, R = restart, V = reveal answer

## Features

- All 50 US state names in the word bank
- Visual hangman drawing on canvas
- Win/loss tracking and win rate percentage
- Keyboard and click support
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## Built With

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (single file)
- [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) — AI pair programmer
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — code editor

## Why This Exists

If you're in tech sales, partner management, alliances, or any non-engineering role and think coding isn't for you — this project is proof that the barrier to building isn't technical skill anymore. It's willingness to start.
